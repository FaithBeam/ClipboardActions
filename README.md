# ClipboardActions

This is a Windows system tray program that monitors what you copy to your clipboard and opens programs based on regexes you set.
For example, when you copy a YouTube url, you can open VLC or any video player of your choice and play that video.

This is alpha software, so there will be bugs. Please create an issue.

# Usage

1. Open ClipboardActions.exe
2. Right click its icon in the system tray
3. Click settings
4. Fill out the required information

The only variable substitution at this point is {URL}
